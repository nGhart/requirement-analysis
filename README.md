# Requirement Analysis
A project helps define and organize requirements for a booking system, building a clear plan for software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting what a software system must do and the conditions it must meet. It ensures that developers build the right product that meets user and business needs.

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it sets the foundation for all subsequent stages of development.

#### **1. Defines Project Scope**
It helps identify what the system should accomplish, who will use it, and what problems it aims to solve. Clear scope prevents confusion and scope creep later in development.

#### **2. Improves Communication**
By documenting requirements, all stakeholders — including clients, developers, and testers — share a common understanding of project goals and expectations.

#### **3. Reduces Development Errors**
Thorough analysis minimizes misunderstandings, rework, and feature misalignment, saving both time and resources.

#### **4. Ensures Better Quality**
Well-defined and validated requirements lead to a product that meets user needs, performs efficiently, and aligns with business objectives.

#### **5. Supports Testing and Validation**
Test cases are built around the documented requirements, ensuring each function can be verified against its intended purpose.
