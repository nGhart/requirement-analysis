# Requirement Analysis
A project helps define and organize requirements for a booking system, building a clear plan for software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
---

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting what a software system must do and the conditions it must meet. It ensures that developers build the right product that meets user and business needs.

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it sets the foundation for all subsequent stages of development.

#### **1. Defines Project Scope**
It helps identify what the system should accomplish, who will use it, and what problems it aims to solve. Clear scope prevents confusion and scope creep later in development.

#### **2. Improves Communication**
By documenting requirements, all stakeholders, including clients, developers, and testers, share a common understanding of project goals and expectations.

#### **3. Reduces Development Errors**
Thorough analysis minimizes misunderstandings, rework, and feature misalignment, saving both time and resources.

#### **4. Ensures Better Quality**
Well-defined and validated requirements lead to a product that meets user needs, performs efficiently, and aligns with business objectives.

#### **5. Supports Testing and Validation**
Test cases are built around the documented requirements, ensuring each function can be verified against its intended purpose.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
---

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it ensures that the software being built aligns with user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility. Without it, projects risk failure due to unclear objectives or misaligned expectations.

### **1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep**
Clear and well-documented requirements create a shared understanding between developers, clients, and stakeholders.  
This minimizes confusion, reduces rework, and prevents the project scope from expanding beyond what was originally planned.

### **2. Saves Time and Resources**
By identifying issues, constraints, and missing information early in the development process, teams can avoid costly redesigns and delays later on.  
Good requirement analysis streamlines development, improves estimation accuracy, and ensures efficient resource allocation.

### **3. Ensures Product Quality and User Satisfaction**
Thoroughly analyzed and validated requirements lead to software that truly meets user expectations and business objectives.  
When the team clearly understands *what* to build and *why*, the result is a more reliable, usable, and high-quality product.

### **4. Supports Better Testing and Validation**
Requirements provide the basis for creating test cases and acceptance criteria.  
This makes it easier to verify that each feature works as intended and that the final product fulfills its intended purpose.
